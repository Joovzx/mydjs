## Running it yourself
**Requirements:** (Things that require an external installation)
- Node.js v12+ (Version requirement may change at any time.)

Clone the repository or fetch it however you want:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/TheFateAkira/discordjs-v12-template
$ cd discordjs-v12-template
```
Install dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
```
Fill in the fields in `settings.json`

Finally run the bot using `node index.js` (use pm2/nodemon, whatever you want)

Self-hosting is more aimed towards contributing rather than running your own instance, there will be lot of changes you have to do to make it truly yours which is not recommended and you will not recieve support. That being said I don't mind too much if you run an instance but please don't claim it as your own.

Be sure to join our [support server](https://discord.gg/bJemK26) for feedback and discussions when contributing or just to hang out. We like to meet new people so come and say hi!
