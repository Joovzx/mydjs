## Running it yourself
**Requirements:** (Things that require an external installation)
- Node.js v12+ (Version requirement may change at any time.)

Clone the repository or fetch it however you want:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/TheFateAkira/discordjs-v12-template
$ cd discordjs-v12-template
```
Install dependencies
```sh
$ npm install
```
Fill in the fields in `settings.json`

Finally run the bot using `node index.js` (use pm2/nodemon, whatever you want)

Self-hosting is more aimed towards contributing rather than running your own instance.

Be sure to join our [support server](https://discord.gg/bJemK26) for feedback and discussions when contributing or just to hang out. We like to meet new people so come and say hi!
